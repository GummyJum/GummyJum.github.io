<p><br />I am an engineer by heart, i like to learn, build random overcomplex structures (physical and mental) and start new intriguing projects.</p>
<p><br />I will use this space to share some of my limited experience and also as a gallery for the arbitrary projects i am currently working on.</p>
<p><br />My intersts so far are as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>High performance computing (HPC) and distributed algorithms</li>
<li>Signal processing and statistical machine learning (Audio, Image and radar)</li>
<li>Robotics (Arduino, RPi and other low cost playable hardware)</li>
</ul>
