<h1>My First Game</h1>

<p>I developed my first game on my early programing days at 2013.</p>

<p>I have just learned the skillset of graphic engines in java and basic linear algebra. It all made perfect sense to me then and i end up making a game that was fun for me to play at the time.</p>

<p><a href="?page=02122020 My First Game/tetris madness.html">You can play it yourself</a></p>

<p>This is not the original version (which was lost in time), i worked up a little mockup in javascript and HTML canvas.</p>

<p>It was a very positive experiance for me, it pushed me towrad computer science and scientific computing.</p>

<p>I ended up making another interesting game/simulation that year which was not as much fun to play as this but was interesting and complex. </p>
