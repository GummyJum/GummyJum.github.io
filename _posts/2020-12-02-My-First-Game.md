I developed my first game in my early programing days in 2013.

I had just learned the skillset of graphic engines in Java and basic linear algebra. 
It all made perfect sense to me then and I ended up making a game that was fun for me to play at the time.

[You can play it yourself](/tetris)

This is not the original version (which was lost in time), I worked up a little mockup in javascript and HTML canvas.

It was a very positive experience for me, and it pushed me toward computer science and scientific computing.

I ended up making another interesting game/simulation that year which was not as much fun to play but was interesting and complex. It probably deserves another post.
