I developed my first game on my early programing days at 2013.

I have just learned the skillset of graphic engines in java and basic linear algebra. It all made perfect sense to me then and i end up making a game that was fun for me to play at the time.

[You can play it yourself](/tetris)

This is not the original version (which was lost in time), i worked up a little mockup in javascript and HTML canvas.

It was a very positive experiance for me, it pushed me toward computer science and scientific computing.

I ended up making another interesting game/simulation that year which was not as much fun to play but was interesting and complex and will probably deserves another post.
